//  This file provides the private interface to the initialization code.
//
//  Most of the complexity here is in the dance of cleanups.  A variable
//  may have up to two cleanups associated with it:
//
//    - A deallocation cleanup, which deletes a heap-allocated variable
//      without invoking its destructor.  This is required when the
//      initializer can throw without the variable being properly
//      initialized.  This is a full-expression cleanup pushed
//      immediately within the heap-allocation but contained within the
//      initializer.  It is deactivated at the instant of initialization for
//      the initializer.
//    - A release/destroy cleanup.  For a heap-allocated variable, this
//      releases the owner, possibly invoking the destructor;  for a
//      stack-allocated variable, this simply destroys the object.
//      It has the lifetime of the actual variable.  It is pushed,
//      inactive, outside the initializer full-expression.
