Swift classes in detail
=======================

FIXME: This document is describing where we want to be; many pieces aren't
implemented yet.

Syntax overview
---------------

::

  class MyClass {
    var MyVar : Int
    func f(x : Int) -> Int {
      return MyVar + x
    }
    static func getAMyclass() -> MyClass {
      return new MyClass
    }
    constructor() {
      MyVar = 10
    }
    destructor {
      // Misc finalization
    }
  }

  extension MyClass {
    func g() -> Int {
      return 4
    }
  }

  func f() {
    var x = new MyClass(10)
  }
  
  class MyDerived : MyClass {
    func h() {}
  }
  

Constructing an instance of a class
-----------------------------------
::

  var x = new MyClass(10)

This syntax basically just calls the constructor found by overload resolution
on the given class.

FIXME: There's been some debate whether we should allow default construction
of classes, or constructing a class with ``MyClass(10)`` on an opt-in basis.
We might want to take another look here later.

Inheritance
-----------

A class inherits from at most one other class.  The base class is named in
the same place protocols are named; if a base class is named, it must come
first in the list.  All member functions/properties of the
base class can be accessed through an instance of the derived class 
(ignoring access control and shadowing).  Constructors are never inherited; see
the section on constructors.  Destructors have special rules; see the section
on destructors.

Constructors
------------
::

  constructor() {
    MyVar = 10
  }

This syntax defines a constructor, which is called to build an instance of
the object.  

If no constructors are defined, an implicit constructor is defined which
takes no arguments and implicitly initializes all ivars and the base class.

A constructor in the derived class must delegate to a constructor in the
base class.

The exact syntax for initialization of ivars/delegation to the base class
is still sort of an open question. There are a few possible models here:

1. All ivars are implicitly initialized before the body of the constructor.
   Initializers can be provided on the ivar directly if necessary.  This is the
   closest to the current model.  This was discarded & sucks because it doesn't
   allow initialization based on arguments.
2. Some sort of C++-style list of initializers; this was discarded quickly
   during discussion as being both ugly and not as flexible as we would like.
3. Add some sort of init block to constructors, like::

      constructor (x : Int) {
        init {
          myIvar = x
        }
        print(myIvar)
      }

   Capturing self in the init block would be banned because it could allow
   uses of uninitialized ivars.  If an ivar is accessed before initialization,
   or not initialized in the init block, it would be automatically
   "default"-initialized (as-if with an empty argument list) if such
   construction is possible, or an error otherwise. The ivar rules would
   be enforced using CFG analysis.  Delegation to the base class would be in
   the init block; the syntax here is also an open question.  Proposals
   included ``super(1,2)``, ``constructor(1,2)``, ``This(1,2)``,
   ``MyBaseClass(1,2)``.  In the delegation case, the init block would not
   access ``self`` at all, and would perform a delegation call at the end
   (syntax also undecided).

   This approach sucks simply because it's ugly.  There are a couple of
   alternative ways to express this, including some sort of explicit
   ``constructed`` marker, but I'm not sure we can come up with a variant
   which isn't ugly.

4. Implicitly deduce an init block using the CFG::

      constructor (x : Int) {
        // init implicitly begins here
        myIvar = x
        // init implicitly ends here
        myMethod()
      }

   Essentially the same semantic rules as (3), but less ugly (and possibly
   slightly more flexible in the presence of control flow because there
   could be multiple end-points).  The downside here is that it isn't obvious
   at a glance where exactly the split occurs, which could lead to unexpected
   default construction.  Also, it could lead to surprises when refactoring
   code.

Destructors
-----------

A destructor is defined using just the keyword destructor followed by a
brace-stmt.  Destructors can only be defined in classes, and only in the
class declaration itself.  It's a runtime error if the body resurrects the
object (i.e. if there are live reference to the object after the body of
the destructor runs).  Member ivars are destroyed after the body of the
destructor runs.  FIXME: Where exactly do we run the base class destructor?
FIXME: We don't actually detect resurrection at the moment.

Member functions and properties
-------------------------------

Like structs, classes have member functions, properties, and ivars.
Unlike structs, member functions and properties are overridable (and use
dynamic dispatch) by default.  Overriding can be disabled with the "final"
attribute.

In a derived class, if a member function or variable is defined with the
same name and kind as a member of its base class, or a subscript operator
is defined, it can override a member of the base class. The rules for resolving
a set of derived class members with the same name against the set of base
class members with that name are as follows:

  1. If there's a derived class member whose type and kind exactly match the
     base class member, the member overrides the that base class member.
  2. If there's a subtyping relationship with a single base class member 
     which is not overridden by any other member by rule 1, the method
     overrides that base class method.  It's an error if there are
     multiple potential base class methods, or multiple methods which would
     override a single base class method.
  3. If all the base class methods have been overridden by rules 1 and 2,
     the method introduces a new overload.
  4. Otherwise, the member declaration is invalid.
      
Defining a type with the same name as a base class member is not allowed.

FIXME: Revisit "shadow" and "overload" attributes when we start looking at
resiliency.

.. This model requires two attributes to control it when the default isn't 
   correct: "shadow" and "overload".  A member with either of these attributes
   never overrides a base class method.  "overload" means that the member of
   the derived class is an overload of the base class member;
   all the members from the base class and the derived class are part of
   overload resolution.  Each member which adds a new overload needs the
   "overload" attribute.  "shadow" means that the derived class is
   intentionally shadowing the base class name; the name from the base class
   is never found by name lookup on the derived class.  If any member with a
   given name has the "shadow" attribute, every member with that name must
   have it.  (Note that this means either none of the base class members with
   a given name are shadowed, or all of them are; more sophisticated models
   are possible, but this seems like a reasonable compromise in terms of
   complexity.)

FIXME: is adding an override for a method from a base class allowed in a
stable API? 

Accessing overridden members of the base class
----------------------------------------------

Tentatively, ``super.foo()`` accesses foo from the parent class, bypassing
dynamic dispatch.

Extensions
----------

Extensions for structs can only contain methods, properties,
and constructors. They always use static dispatch.

Extensions for classes are more flexible in two respects:

1. They can contains ivars: these are essentially baking in language support
   for the equivalent of a side-table lookup.  They must be either
   default-initializable or have an explicit initializer on the variable
   definition.  The initializer is run lazily.  (If the ivar is in the same
   resilience scope as the class, we can optimize the allocation.)
2. Members of extensions of classes can be overridden (?).  Per our discussion
   in the meeting, I thought this model could work, but in retrospect it might
   be way too confusing; if you have a base class X and a derived class Y,
   overriding an extension of X in an extension of Y leads to strange behavior
   depending on whether the extension of Y is loaded (essentially, the same
   weirdness of ObjC categories and linking).

Name lookup for extensions works much the same way that it does for a derived
class, except that rather than base class vs. derived class, it's names from
current extension vs. names from other sources (or something similar to this).
If there's multiple declarations with the same name, it's an error, and the
user has to resolve it with "shadow" and "overload" (where "shadow" only works
for names from other modules; we'll want some other mechanism for name remapping
for protocol implementations).  The shadow and overload attributes work
essentially the same way they work for class definitions.

Constructors in extensions are required to delegate to another constructor. This
is necessary because of access-control etc.  (FIXME: implicit delegation?)

ObjC Interop, high-level summary
--------------------------------
We currently plan to allow making a class a ObjC class by inheriting directly
or indirectly from NSObject. An ObjC class has ObjC metadata, and can be used
where ObjC classes can be used.  Further details in the area are still up in
the air.  We will provide syntax for defining ObjC methods which correspond
to a specific selector.  Many details here are still up in the air.

Defining ObjC methods
-----------------------------

Given a method looking something like the following in ObjC (loosely
based on an NSView method)::

  - (void) addTrackingRect:(NSRect)rect  owner:(id)owner withUserData:(id)data, assumeInside:(BOOL)assumeInside

We tentatively decided to do something like the following::

  func addTrackingRect(rect : NSRect)
       owner(owner : Id)
       withUserData(data : Id)
       assumeInside(inside : Bool) -> Void {
    // Impl
  }

Note that the names inside the parentheses do not affect the type system; the
type of this declaration is
``(NSRect, owner : Id, withUserData : Id, assumeInside : Bool) -> Void``.
This syntax is just sugar to allow giving arguments sane names for
the implementation and possibly for documentation.  Being able to rename
for the implementation is particularly important for byref arguments,
because they can't easily be renamed with a var decl in the implementation.

The basic weakness here is that it requires a syntax extension to function
declarations with two or more arguments, which we probably would not have
included if not for ObjC interop.

We seriously considered two other proposals for the declaration in swift.  One::

  func addTrackingRect(rect : NSRect, owner : Id, withUserData : Id, assumeInside : Bool) {
    // Impl
  }

(The selector parts come from the argument names, with the first argument
ignored.) The obvious weaknesses here are that it doesn't correspond at all
to a selector and that the implementation has to use a parameter named
"withUserData"; this was rejected for being unintuitive and ugly.

The second proposal was a variant of this which tried to solve the "withUserData"
problem with some combination of heuristics and annotations. Chris
categorically opposed this on the basis that requiring strange annotations
to write Objective-C classes in Swift makes ObjC a second-class citizen.

Calling ObjC methods
--------------------

Given the above form for method definitions, we iterated a bunch of times on the
callee side, but eventually settled for something like Greg's proposal
on swift-dev::

  A.addTracking(r, owner = o, withUserData = d, assumeInside = False)

This has the advantages of being a straightforward translation for most
methods, and not requiring us to introduce any new ObjC-specific syntax
at the caller side.

The other possibility which we seriously considered was the ObjC-style
square-brackets.  Square-brackets have the advantage of familiarity, but
we've tentatively rejected them on the basis that it fractures the language:
if we don't allow the style for all methods, it makes swift and
objective-swift separate dialects, and if we do allow it, it leads to
never-ending style wars.
